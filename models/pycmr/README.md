# pyCMR

Python-based object-oriented implementation of the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model.  Currently in a very early stage of development.

## Notes
* See Projects and Issues for next-up to-do items
* scratch_ifr_pycmr.py: Contains sample code for setting some basic parameters and running a bare-bones simulation of immediate free recall.  At a command line, you can try: python scratch_ifr_pycmr.py
* ncms_classes.py: Contains all of the code for all of the classes currently, will have to break these out into separate files and come up with a good naming convention. It doesn't make sense to call this ncms, except to the extent that a particular class is general to a bunch of models.  Could split things up so that the network-related and task-related classes are separate.
